### Talk about growth mindset

Overall the idea of growth mindset means, to me, 
that through _effort, struggle, and correcting mistakes,_ 
one can learn and improve.

This is contrast to a fixed mindset, which attributes
learning and other types of success to innate traits
that can't be developed and improved upon.

### 3 reminders for growth mindset:

  1. Push the I believe button
     - When faced with difficulty, persevere by using positive self-talk
  2. You may not know yet, but you will soon
     - Everyone starts somewhere.  Even experts were once beginners
  3. Mistakes are the path to learning
     - A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.  Use your mistakes, 
    correct them, and learn from them
