## Talk about growth mindset

Overall the idea of growth mindset means, to me, 
that through _effort, struggle, and correcting mistakes,_ 
one can learn and improve.

This is contrast to a fixed mindset, which attributes
learning and other types of success to innate traits
that can't be developed and improved upon.

### 3 reminders for growth mindset:

  1. Push the I believe button
     - When faced with difficulty, persevere by using positive self-talk
  2. You may not know yet, but you will soon
     - Everyone starts somewhere.  Even experts were once beginners
  3. Mistakes are the path to learning
     - A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.  Use your mistakes, 
    correct them, and learn from them


## Markdown

According to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), markdown allows user to: 

> Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax 


Essentially it allows users to format and customize web pages without knowledge of HTML and CSS. An exmaple of Markdown applied to heading follows:

```# Heading level 1``` will display as 

# Heading level 1.

```## Heading level 2``` will display as 

## Heading level 2.  

The smallest heading, ```###### Heading level 6``` 

will appear as ###### Heading level 6.

More information on specific usage can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).



## Text editors and the terminal

Allows you to write and manage text…one of the most important tools of a web developer.

Doesn’t matter which one you use, they’re more about personal choice, as long as they have 
certain features.
