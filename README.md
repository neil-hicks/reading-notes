### Talk about growth mindset

Overall the idea of growth mindset means, to me, 
that through effort, struggle, and correcting mistakes, 
one can learn and improve.

This is contrast to a fixed mindset, which attributes
learning and other types of success to innate traits
that can't be developed and improved upon.

3 reminders for growth mindset:

  * Push the I believe button
    *  When faced with difficulty, persevere by using positive self-talk
  * You may not know yet, but you will soon
    *  Everyone starts somewhere.  Even experts were once beginners
  * Mistakes are the path to learning
    * A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.  Use your mistakes, 
    correct them, and learn from them
