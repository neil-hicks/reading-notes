## Wireframing and HTML

### Wireframing

Wireframe and design

Wireframing is a process that is used before the actual website is built to make sure that the plan for the site, the information contained and the UX are in place.  

Done in plain black and white to make sure the site it organized effectively before adding additional  elements which can be distracting

Wireframes can be:

- Hand drawn
- Paper prototypes
- Software-designed

Things to consider before wireframing

  1. Understand your audience
  2. Prepare your reference materials
  3. Map out flow
  4. Put pen to paper (literally or figuratively) and sketch out plan without going into too much detail
  5. Add detail and test
  6. Turn frames into prototypes

3 principles of good wireframes

- Simple
- User confidence
- Clear

### HTML

Basic structure of the web.  It provides the framework of the information found on all webpages.  Later, other tools will be used to adjust appearance (CSS) and the functions of the website (JavaScript).  

HTML uses elements to make the content do what is expected.  

HTML documents use the following elements that form the basis of each page

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src=" " alt=" ">
  </body>
</html>
```

Additionally, HTML can be used to identify headings within the content.
The heading levels are as follows, in descending size order:

```
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
down to 
<h6></h6>
```

Lists are made using ```<ul></ul>``` (unordered) and the ```<ol></ol>``` (ordered) elements.
Items within each of the lists are wrapped in the ```<li></li>``` element.
