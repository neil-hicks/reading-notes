# Class 7 Notes

## The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
> function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}

### JavaScript Function Syntax

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
> function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
// code to be executed
}

### Javascript Operators

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
