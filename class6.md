# Class 6 Notes

## JavaScript reading notes

Most well-known scripting language for web pages (not to be confused with Java, a very different language).

### Variables hold values.  Variables are like a box and the value is whatâ€™s in the box.

4 ways to declare variables
    1. Using var
    2. Using let
    3. Using const
    4. Using nothing

Variable must be identified with unique names.

> The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
   > - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
   > - Names must begin with a letter
   > - Names can also begin with $ and _ 
   > - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
> - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
